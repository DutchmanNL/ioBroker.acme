## ACME adapter for ioBroker

Generates certificates using ACME challenges.

## Usage

The adapter start periodically (default at midnight) and generates any required certificates.

**TODO:** Certificates are **not yet saved**! Awaiting adapter core updates.

Two methods of challenge verification are implemented:

* http-01: The adapter starts it's own http-01 challenge server on the configured port and address.
  
   For http-01 challenge to be successful the challenge server's port/address must be publicly reachable from port 80 of the FQDN given in a collection common/alt names from the open internet. Configure your firewall accordingly.
* dns-01: Various dns-01 challenges are implemented.
